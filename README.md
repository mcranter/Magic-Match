        2. As a casual gamer I want the gameplay mechanism to be immediately obvious.
        3. If a level is too hard, I want the option to quit.

    -   #### Experienced Player Goals

        1. As an experienced gamer I want to be challenged.
        2. As an experienced gamer I want a game that encourages repeat plays.

    -   #### Game Designer's Goals

*   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are Yellow (#ebd512) and dark-orange (#f0Ad4e) for titles and modal backgrounds and Black and White for fonts.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Grenze Gotisch font is the main font used in the game. This font was chosen for its evocative qualities, conjuring a gothic yet 'magical' sensibility that reflects the game's theme.
        -   Grenze Gotisch is a Google Font.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The castle background is intended to compliment the 'Grenze Gotisch' font by reflecting the magical, gothic theme.
    -   #### Layout
        -   Bootstrap was used to assist with the layout and styling of the landing menu but was not used as the basis for the game board due to the unsuitability of its [Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) containers.

## Features

### Existing Features

-   Sounds: This game uses sounds to alert the player to various events (like the existence of a match, victory or the end of the game.) Using sounds during these events also helps create [positive reinforcement ](https://game-design-snacks.fandom.com/wiki/Positive_Reinforcement_Through_Audio_Visual_Cues) which encourages repeat game playing.

-   Interactive play mechanism playable on all devices.


### Future Features

-   Scoreboard: A scoreboard would add to the competitive element of the game and increase replay value.

-   Card Match counter: Not included initially due to concerns about the display looking crowded (with flip, time, and level already displayed).

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### General User Goals

    1. "As a user, I want to be able to read instruction detailing how to play the game."

        1. The landing page contains a 'How to Play' explanatory text modal.
        
    2. "As a user,  I want to be able to toggle on/off the game's music."

        1. Each game level contains a 'Play/Pause' toggle sound option, enabling the user to turn the music on or off. 

    3. "As a user, I want to be able to keep track of the amount of flips it has taken me to complete the game."

        1. The flip counter - which keeps a running total of the flips - is clearly displayed above the game board.
        
    4. "As a user, I want to see how long it has taken me to complete the game."

        1. The Time counter - which displays the time and begins counting after the first flip - is clearly visible above the game board.
        
    5. "As a user, I want an alert when I get a match."

        1. A brief audio clip plays when two cards are matched. 


-   #### Casual Player Goals

    1. "As a casual gamer, my priority is a fun gameplay experience.".

        1. The Easy level is designed for entry-level play: the number of cards (12) is "manageable" and there is an extended time counter (100 seconds). This means the player can focus on the game task without worrying about time constraints.

    2. "As a casual gamer I want the gameplay mechanism to be immediately obvious."

        1. The layout of the game play page(s) follows a standard, familiar format - once the player clicks a card, they are shown the reverse side and the aim of the game becomes obvious: click cards over and find all the matches.

        2. The landing (index.html) page contains a clearly labelled 'How to play' button/modal which informs the player of the gameplay mechanics.

    3. "If a level is too hard, I want the option to quit."

        1. Each level contains a 'quit' button under the game board.
        2. The Game Over/ Victory contains a 'quit' option.


-   #### Experienced Player Goals

    1. "As an experienced gamer I want to be challenged."
        1. The game has 3 levels of difficulty, increasing in difficulty. The player can either clear each level, starting at Easy and playing through to Hard, or select from 'Easy', 'Medium' or 'Hard' in the Play menu on the game's landing page.
        2. The Hard level is designed to be a challenge even to experienced players, with limited time (60 seconds) to match 16 cards.

    2. "As an experienced gamer I want a game that encourages repeat plays."
        1. The incremental increase in difficulty encourages continuous, repeatitive play. 
        2. The difficulty of the Hard level, though not prohibitively difficult, is challenging enough that it should take more than one play to beat.

-   #### Game Designer's Goals

    1. "To engage and entertain both casual and experienced game players"

        1. This is achieved through a combination of easy-to-understand gameplay mechanics and the abilty to either select a level based on difficulty. 

    2. "To create an enjoyable, rewarding bug-free gameplay experience."

        1. Much testing has been done to assure that the game looks and plays well on all devices.

    3.  "To encourage multiple replays."

        1. This is achieved by making the game enjoyable and easy to interact. Players who 'beat' the Hard level are rewarded with an amusing message of congratulations from Professor Dumbledore.

### Further Testing

-   The game was tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers (Mac OS) 
-   The website was viewed and tested on a variety of devices, mobile and desktop (Samsung J3/iPhone SE & others via Chrome's Developer Tools). 
-   Friends and family members were asked to play the game and point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
-   Peers at Code Institute (devices included: iPhone 11 Pro) tested, and their findings (shared with me on Slack) are visible [here](https://monosnap.com/file/3LJAkPq6OlAW9toRK87woo5blSs7tZ).

-   Resolved: Issue with cards not flipping in Safari - fixed as per [this](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_backface-visibility.asp) W3 documentation.
-   Resolved: Console error displaying 'Uncaught TypeError: ".card".removeClass is not a function' resovled with the help of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41495836/uncaught-typeerror-element-removeclass-is-not-a-function-in-jquery) Stack Overflow post.
-   Resovled: 'GET https://github.io/favicon.ico 404' console display. Resolved with the help of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35037482/favicon-with-github-pages) Stack Overflow post. A favicon (a wand) was added to solve this.
-   Unresolved: Issue with the font on the index.html resizing after upgrading from Bootstrap v3.4 to v4.5. This discrepancy (visible [here](https://monosnap.com/file/OJYXpIEmsqV3bEit9zWXK219XRpkNz)), although investigated with the assistance of Bootstrap's [migration documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/) and Code Institute [tutor support](https://monosnap.com/file/zs5pAwUCljJD9QXHEucQYFsdtA9Ixc) remains unexplained. As a result I reverted to using an earlier version of Bootstrap (v3.4).
-   Resolved: Issue with 'Uncaught TypeError, cannot read property of 'paused' of null' appearing on the Hard game level only was resolved with the assistance of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48177691/cannot-read-property-pause-of-null-at-play-pause) Stack Overflow post. Ultimately moving the animationHard.js script to the end of the page solved the issue. 

### Known Bugs
-   Ongoing: Issue with font sizing on Game Options page on both iPhone 5 and Galaxy Fold devices in Chrome's Developer Tools, unresolved by media queries.
-   Occassional issue with victory modal not popping on Medium Level.
